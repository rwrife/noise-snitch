# noise-snitch 🔊🕵️

**A tiny Windows tray app that snitches on which app just made that sound.**

That random *ding*. The phantom notification. The ad talking from a buried browser tab. noise-snitch keeps a live blotter of every sound your PC makes and names the guilty process — caller ID for your speakers.

---

## Why?

Windows shows you a *live* volume mixer, but the instant a sound stops, the evidence is gone. There's no history, no "what was THAT 8 seconds ago?" noise-snitch fills that gap: it watches per-app audio sessions, catches the moment an app *starts* making noise, and logs **who, when, and how loud** — right from your system tray.

## Status

🚧 Early. See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the roadmap and [issues](https://github.com/rwrife/noise-snitch/issues) for milestones.

## Planned MVP (v0.1)

- Lives in the **system tray**, no main window.
- Detects when any app goes **silent → making sound**.
- Logs **timestamp · process name · peak level · session name**.
- A tray **flyout blotter** of recent noise events, newest first.
- Tray icon **flashes** when someone gets snitched on.

## Stack

C# / .NET 8 · [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) (WASAPI / Core Audio sessions) · WinForms `NotifyIcon`. Boring, fast, Windows-native — ships as a single `.exe`.

## Build (once scaffolded)

```sh
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run --project src
```
